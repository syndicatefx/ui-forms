# UI-forms

Ready to serve HTML form elements styles, adjust styles to taste by using the `src/config.css` file, or dive into the rest of the code and do what ever you want with it!

## Usage

Clone this repo, make sure you have node.js and npm installed, then:

- Run `npm start` to play around and view your changes
- Run `npm build` if you just want to compile a ready for production `ui-forms.min.css` in the `css/` directory
